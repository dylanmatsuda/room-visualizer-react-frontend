# room-visualizer-react-frontend
This repo contains an end-to-end UI flow designed using a Javascript/React to allow a user to add, remove, duplicate, and select different "room visualizer" views. A carousel layout was employed, and the single room view could be adjusted to incorporate a web widget to add/remove furniture from the room in the future.
